We combined our love of craft beer (first envisioned in print through the Mash Tun Journal) with our desire to make our city a better place to live, work, and play by creating Marz Community Brewing Co. With the encouragement of our friends in the Chicago craft brewing community, we opened our first nano-production facility in a storefront on Halsted Street, using a quaint 3-barrel Psycho Brew system. /nThe early years of Marz saw the creation of our flagship wheat ale, Jungle Boogie, as well as our Bubbly Creak sour series and some of our more exotic concoctions (What the Pho, Nasal Cavity, Dilliner Weiss, etc.). Through hard work, dedication, and an adherence to experimentation, we overcame our tight production quarters to continuously churn out beers that would both push the envelope of what American beer could be, while providing brews that the Bridgeport and greater craft beer community would find enjoyable. /nIn 2018, we moved across the Bubbly Creek into the Central Manufacturing District of McKinley Park, where we built our new mothership facility designed to expand our production capabilities while also showcasing the myriad talents of our team of brewers, artists, musicians, designers, weirdos, and collaborators—the very Community that helps make Marz what it is. /nMarz now brews on a 15-barrel brewhouse, with 15- and 30-bbl tanks, a 15-bbl foeder, our own canning line, and a continuously growing barrel program, all designed to allow us to make small batches of handcrafted beer and other delicious liquids, such as kombucha, yerba, shrub sodas, and house-made seltzers. /nWe pride ourselves on giving back to the community that has given us so very much. As such, we help support numerous non-profits and a wide-ranging cultural and social advocacy community to build a better world for our employees, customers, family, friends, and neighbors. As Marz continues to expand, we hope you’ll find yourself a member of that community. /n"

They did other stuff for a while and then they figured out they were better at making beer than at the other stuff. So that's what they do now. They met while both studied at the oldest and most respected brewing school (of the two...and by the brewers that went to the one) in the US, the Siebel Institute, in 2008 and the brewery was envisioned while they both interned at Metropolitan Brewing afterwards. Most of Off Color's business plan is based off of Doug and Tracy at Metro knowing what they're doing, so you should go buy some of their beer too. After cutting their teeth at larger breweries, the two somehow convinced enough otherwise-very-smart-people to invest enough money for them to buy some big shiny things to make their own beer in. So that's what they do now."
