Margaritas… and tacos. But we make beer, so we decided to add lime juice to our gose beer lending a bright citric acid character to the existing lactic acid creating a beer with complex tartness. The wheat body is accented by a hefty dose of pink Himalayan salt to pair perfectly with tequila... and tacos.\n Beer for Tacos® is blended from two different beers and then refermented with lime. The base beer is fermented with a Belgian yeast strain and spiced with coriander, while the second beer is fermented solely with Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus adds a refreshing tartness to beer. While the Lime juice adds a bright acidity in its own right."

The heat produced during fermentation (typically removed by the fermenter’s cooling jackets) warms up the fermenting beer and enhances the fruity ester profile. After fermentation is completed, we add a generous dose of Crystal hops to the cooled beer for a shorter period of time to extract all the finer hop oils."

The flavor addition is inspired by the secret “Seven X” blend of citrus, cinnamon, and nutmeg for a juicy, yet spicy/sweet botanical kick. Kola provides a slight caffeine boost while a crisp carbonation enhances the mouthfeel.\nCaffeine (and the name) of Cola was originally provided by the kola nut, native to the rainforests of Africa. This caffeine rich nut was chewed as a pick me up and was a common ingredient in old-timey tonics including a now world famous tonic that included extract from the coca plant. Kola nuts are no longer used in modern colas and instead are replaced with caffeine extract, but Beer for Pizza uses the kola nut as its source for a mild caffeine kick. 	 "

Very, Very Far adds a twist on the spirit of Belgian mixed fermentation brewing by utilizing a non-traditional wine yeast, Torulaspora delbrueckii. The Torulaspora yeast feasts on the simple sugars before fermentation is completed with the addition of a traditional Belgian yeast strain. The symbiotic fermentation causes an elevated ethyl ester fruit profile in the final beer."

Rich and sultry with a deep, almost foreboding sense of claustrophobic warmth. Raucous bourbon, seductive brownie batter malts, and a sort of impossibly silky body. \n Almost 23 months of extended bourbon barrel aging to slowly coax intensely caramelized wood sugars from deep within the charred oak."
